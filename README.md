### 20Time Project Proposal (Albert ICS4U)

#### Project Description
For my 20Time project I try being a YouTuber. I will be making videos about North Korea and why they are such a great threat
to the rest of the world, now that they are a nuclear state. I will also do videos about Kim Jong Un's cult of personality,
the North Korean propaganda machine, and what life is like inside North Korea. I will do research on this topic by watching
videos from other YouTubers, reading articles, and reading books written by North Korean defectors.

#### Intended Audience
The intended audience of my YouTube videos will be people interested in world issues and politics, but I will try to make my
videos educational and entertaining at the same time, so maybe my channel will attract other viewers as well.

#### Timeline
I will try to film videos on Sunday, and then spend the week editing and improving them so that they are as good as they can be.
Then I will release them the following Saturday. This plan may change in the future. If I am busy with homework from my other 
classes, then I will have to do bi-weekly uploads instead.

#### Resources Required
1. Computer (already have)
2. Camera (already have)
3. Lavalier microphone (will buy from eBay or someplace)
4. Video editing software (already have)
5. A fancy suit and tie (already have)
6. A Kim Il Sung lapel pin like the one Kim Jong Un wears (will buy)
