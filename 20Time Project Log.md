## 20Time Project Log

### Albert Wang, ICS4U (Mr. Osudar)

In this log, I will be keeping track of the progress in my 20Time Project, in which I will try being a YouTuber
and making videos to raise awareness about human rights abuses in North Korea and the treat that North Korea's
nuclear program poses to the world. I will update this log as frequently as I can, but at the very least I will
have new entries here every Friday or Saturday. Each entry will contain a reflection of what I did that week, how
well I think I did, whether or not I met the goal I set for this week, and what I plan to do for the next week.

#### Saturday, September 30, 2017: Day 1

Technically, this isn't Day 1 of my 20time project, because I've been considering this project and preparing for
it for a few weeks now. But since this is my first log entry, we'll call it Day 1. The idea of creating a YouTube
Channel and using it to raise awareness about a world issue has crossed my mind before on several occasions. Part
of the reason for this is I have always wanted to get a feel for what a full-time YouTuber's life is like: making
videos, maintaining a fanbase, and balancing a busy schedule. The top YouTubers have so many subscribers that they
can build an entire career out of their channel and make a living. I do not think that I will ever be one of those
YouTubers, but I would like to at least try it out and determine for myself whether I like being a YouTuber or
not. The other reason why I want to create a YouTube channel is because I have always wanted to make a difference
in the world. There are many issues in our world today that concern me: everything from climate change to racism.
But nothing has been a greater concern to me than the issue of North Korea: the last remaining oppresive totalitarian
military dictatorship in the world. It is my intention to convince at least some people in the international
community to take action against North Korea's many international law violations, human rights abuses, illicit
dealings, and dangerous nuclear program.

I apologize for this first entry being so long, but it is also sort of my introduction log. From now on, they will
almost certainly be shorter. This past week, I  borrowed two books from the library: *Escape From Camp 14* and *A
Thousand Miles To Freedom*. Both are written by North Korean defectors. I finished *Escape from Camp 14* yesterday.
It is an amazing book and if anyone who is reading my log right now has an interest in North Korea like me, I highly
recommend that you read it. I initially read the book out of curiosity and as research for my project, but it has
opened my eyes to a whole other side of North Korea that I have been unaware of until now. I always knew that North
Korea was an oppressive regime under the control of a brutish dictator, and that many of its citizens toil under
threat of torture like slaves. However, I could not anticipate how awful conditions inside North Korean labor camps
are. I am now even more determined than before to go on with my project and raise awareness about the North Korean
issue. I have not started *A Thousand Miles To Freedom* yet, but one of my goals for next week is to get at least
halfway through that book. I have also put together some channel art with a painting app on my MacBook, and will
continue to work on that in the coming weeks, as well. However, my main focus for the coming week will be to create
my new channel, make a catchy name and begin learning how to use video-editing and animation software.

#### Thursday, October 5, 2017: Day 6

Yesterday I acquired a lavalier microphone. I intend to use it to record audio that will be used in my YouTube videos.
I am still learning how to use iMovie, as I do not have a lot of experience with making videos and using video-editing
software. My main source of information in that area comes from articles and video tutorials. I also encountered a small
problem today: my MacBook does not recognize the external microphone, so I currently cannot make use of it. However, I
know from video tutorials that many other people have had the same problem and solved it, so I am determined to try and
figure out how. I might ask the Robotics club teacher at AY for help if I really need to. Once I get over this litle
problem, I can begin making and uploading videos.


#### Saturday, October 7, 2017: Day 8

I had to stay at school until after 11 on Thursday because all Student Council members were needed to help with the dance.
Also, I had to work Friday evening and today at noon. The rest of my time has been taken up by homework from school.
Therefore, I didn't get as much work done on my 20time project as I would have liked. I also have to work next Tuesday, so
this weekend I will try to get all of my homework completed and if I have time left over, I will work on my 20time project.
I haven't figured out how to use the lav mic with my MacBook yet, so I haven't been making videos. But I am rereading *Escape
from Camp 14* and taking research notes. I might ask Mr. O on Tuesday to help me with the microphone. I also need to decide
what I'm going to say in my first video, so I might start putting together a speech and keeping it in the same repo on Github
as my log. So my goals for this coming week will be to fix the problem with the mic and also write the speech. I also decided
on Supreme Leader Albert as my YouTuber name. It's pretty catchy, it's related to the topic I will be making videos on, and it
isn't difficult to remember.


#### Sunday, October 15, 2017: Day 16

This has been sort of a disappointing week. I have a bit of catching up to do on my work. It occurs to me that I still haven't put the 4 completed HTML projects onto a GitHub repo for ICS4U. I will do that immediately after I have finished wriing this log. I also haven't been able to get my external microphone to work with my MacBook. Mr. O has advised me to just make use of the built-in microphone for now in my videos. He's probably right: it's a better idea to go with what already works than to spend money buying a new adapter that may or may not work. So I've decided that this week, I will go ahead with making videos. First, I have to decide what content to include in my videos. I'll probably put that in this repo on GitHub as well. I also have to make some artwork and look for background music and sound effects that I can use in my video. I will also have to keep the videos short (not more than 3 minutes). In spite of this week's setbacks, I believe that the project's results in the end will be all worth it, so I will continue to work hard and get the YouTube channel up and running.

#### Wednesday, October 18, 2017: Day 19

Guess what: another setback. I wanted to get my first video uploaded on the channel this week, but I've had a cough for these last few days, and therefore couldn't record any audio. So it looks like the first video to go up on my channel will have to be sometime next week, at the earliest. But there is some good news: at this point, I've basically mastered iMovie and I've written a transcript of what I will be saying in the video. It's in the same repo as this log on Github. Still working on images and channel art. I've still been going to school these past few days despite my cough (because I don't want to miss anything important in chem and com sci), so that's definitely slowed my recovery process. Hopefully, in the next few days my cough will be gone and my voice will improve. I also finished watching a documentary on North Korea. I'm kind of annoyed that I started this project a month ago and still don't have any videos uploaded, due to several setbacks. However, I did a lot of research and have lots of great ideas about what I could do with my channel. So I'm trying to stay positive.

#### Saturday, October 21, 2017: Day 22

I've decided to limit the size of my videos to between one and two minutes. While that's not a lot of time to provide a large amount of meaningful information, it is enough to spark someone's curiosity and convince them to watch more videos. Because some people might be interested in something, but aren't willing to dedicate a large amount of time to learning and exploring it. That's going to be my target audience for my short, one-minute videos. I'll have to time myself reading my transcripts to make sure that I stay within the time limit. My cough is almost gone now, so I will definitely be able to start recording audio sometime next week. I just hope that nothing else comes up that might delay me further. One thing that kind of bothers me is that whenever Mr. O gives us an entire class to work on our 20time projects, I can't really work on channel art or recording audio, which are the two most important things that I need to do right now. I need my MacBook for that. All I can do on the school computers in the lab is research and writing transcripts for my videos. So I'll be dedicating more of my evenings and weekends to this project.

#### Saturday, October 28, 2017: Day 29

Guess what? More setbacks and delays. My classes have kept me very busy this past week. First of all, there was an in-class essay in English and a unit test in Math that took up most of my study time during the first few days of the week. The in-class essay was on Wednesday and Thursday, and the math test was on Thursday. Also, there was an in-class assignment on Friday. And then, my part-time job scheduled me for shifts on Friday and Saturday(today). That means that I did basically no work on my 20time project this week. Really disappointing. At this point, I am seriously beginning to reconsider my project and wondering whether I should switch and do something easier. Perhaps something related to Student Council, or maybe learning the 4x4 Rubik's cube (I've pretty much mastered the 3x3). I just don't want to be that person who has nothing to show the class when we do our presentations, and I don't want to disappoint my friends and Mr. O after telling everyone what I'm going to do for my project. Maybe I'll talk to Mr. O on Monday and see if he has any tips for how I can better manage my time and plan ahead so that I have time to work on this project. There is some good news, though. I have almost no homework this weekend, and I have an entire day tomorrow to myself. AND I PLAN TO USE EVERY SECOND OF IT TO WORK. NO MORE DELAYS. NO MORE EXCUSES. I'M GOING TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

In other news, I downloaded Atom on my computer and it works very well. Still figuring out how to compile and run code in it. I installed the atom-runner package and node.js, but there are still problems. However, I do have something to work with at this point so I'm pretty happy. Also, I'm learning to use Terminal and Git to work locally on my computer.

#### Saturday, November 4, 2017: Day 36

Well, I've had enough. Last Sunday, I had an entire day to work. I decided to abandon my previous 20time project and spend the time working on a new project: I'm going to make a series of videos on YouTube that are meant to teach beginners how to code in C++. I made a significant amount of progress, and already have one video uploaded on YouTube. I have another two transcripts written for more videos, so I can begin recording and making more videos soon. Things are finally looking better: in just one day, I made more progress on my new project than I did in an entire month with my old project. Maybe I was unmotivated and unwilling to devote too much time to the old project because I lost interest after a while. I don't know. But I'm very optimistic about the new project: coding is something that I enjoy a lot. So is teaching other people. I expect that this new project will be successful. Mr. O also also provided me with some resources that I can look at to help me write better code in C++. So things are looking good.

Now here's where the bad news comes. I am starting to work on Khan Academy projects locally on my computer, using Atom as a text editor. For some reason unbeknownst to me, Atom really doesn't like it when I try to use PVectors in JS. So I am completely stuck until I can get that to work. I might have to ask Mr. O for help. I feel like he might get a little pissed off that I'm constantly asking him for help instead of figuring stuff out on my own, but I've already spent two hours trying to fix this one single problem, and I'm exhausted. But I'm still keeping my hopes up that there's a solution to this problem.

#### Sunday, November 12, 2017: Day 44

I should've done this log yesterday but I forgot. Well, I don't think it'll be too big of a problem. Anyway, I got absolutely nothing done on the actual project itself this past week. Instead, I have been learning about how to run a successful YouTube channel by watching tutorial videos created by other YouTubers. Mostly, the videos were about how to advertise your channel and build it up into a successful one with lots of subscribers. I watched some of these tutorials and saw several examples of good and bad advertising, how I should go about promoting my channel, how to get my first 100 subscribers, etc. Today, I am going to make another C++ tutorial video and upload it. Maybe I'll also make one on how to solve the 3x3 Rubik's cube. For some reason, all of my friends at school are now obsessed with them. About three or four of my friends brought their own cubes to school and told me that they were trying to learn how to solve them. I gave them a few pointers and suggested that maybe I make a video on my YouTube channel about how to solve a Rubik's cube to help them. They liked that idea pretty much. Mr. O has a big box of Rubik's cubes in his com sci class, and some of us learned how to solve them. One of my classmates, whose name I unfortunately cannot recall (I'm not too good with remembering names), has actually made it his 20time project, and can solve a 3x3 cube in just over 30 seconds. So this sudden interest in Rubik's cubes among my friends might be partly because of our com sci class. I myself have mastered the 3x3 (I can solve any 3x3 in under 2 minutes), and also learned how to solve the 4x4 (it's annoying and difficult, but at this point I am skilled enough to solve any 4x4 cube I am given). So, although it's not really relevant to my project, I might consider doing a tutorial video on Rubik's cubes.
