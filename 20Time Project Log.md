# 20Time Project Log

## Albert Wang, ICS4U (Mr. Osudar)

In this log, I will be keeping track of the progress in my 20Time Project, in which I will try being a YouTuber
and making videos to raise awareness about human rights abuses in North Korea and the treat that North Korea's
nuclear program poses to the world. I will update this log as frequently as I can, but at the very least I will
have new entries here every Friday or Saturday. Each entry will contain a reflection of what I did that week, how
well I think I did, whether or not I met the goal I set for this week, and what I plan to do for the next week.

### Saturday, September 30, 2017: Day 1

Technically, this isn't Day 1 of my 20time project, because I've been considering this project and preparing for
it for a few weeks now. But since this is my first log entry, we'll call it Day 1. The idea of creating a YouTube
Channel and using it to raise awareness about a world issue has crossed my mind before on several occasions. Part
of the reason for this is I have always wanted to get a feel for what a full-time YouTuber's life is like: making
videos, maintaining a fanbase, and balancing a busy schedule. The top YouTubers have so many subscribers that they
can build an entire career out of their channel and make a living. I do not think that I will ever be one of those
YouTubers, but I would like to at least try it out and determine for myself whether I like being a YouTuber or
not. The other reason why I want to create a YouTube channel is because I have always wanted to make a difference
in the world. There are many issues in our world today that concern me: everything from climate change to racism.
But nothing has been a greater concern to me than the issue of North Korea: the last remaining oppresive totalitarian
military dictatorship in the world. It is my intention to convince at least some people in the international
community to take action against North Korea's many international law violations, human rights abuses, illicit
dealings, and dangerous nuclear program.

I apologize for this first entry being so long, but it is also sort of my introduction log. From now on, they will
almost certainly be shorter. This past week, I  borrowed two books from the library: *Escape From Camp 14* and *A
Thousand Miles To Freedom*. Both are written by North Korean defectors. I finished *Escape from Camp 14* yesterday.
It is an amazing book and if anyone who is reading my log right now has an interest in North Korea like me, I highly
recommend that you read it. I initially read the book out of curiosity and as research for my project, but it has
opened my eyes to a whole other side of North Korea that I have been unaware of until now. I always knew that North
Korea was an oppressive regime under the control of a brutish dictator, and that many of its citizens toil under
threat of torture like slaves. However, I could not anticipate how awful conditions inside North Korean labor camps
are. I am now even more determined than before to go on with my project and raise awareness about the North Korean
issue. I have not started *A Thousand Miles To Freedom* yet, but one of my goals for next week is to get at least
halfway through that book. I have also put together some channel art with a painting app on my MacBook, and will
continue to work on that in the coming weeks, as well. However, my main focus for the coming week will be to create
my new channel, make a catchy name and begin learning how to use video-editing and animation software.

### Thursday, October 5, 2017: Day 6

Yesterday I acquired a lavalier microphone. I intend to use it to record audio that will be used in my YouTube videos.
I am still learning how to use iMovie, as I do not have a lot of experience with making videos and using video-editing
software. My main source of information in that area comes from articles and video tutorials. I also encountered a small
problem today: my MacBook does not recognize the external microphone, so I currently cannot make use of it. However, I
know from video tutorials that many other people have had the same problem and solved it, so I am determined to try and
figure out how. I might ask the Robotics club teacher at AY for help if I really need to. Once I get over this litle
problem, I can begin making and uploading videos.


### Saturday, October 7, 2017: Day 8

I had to stay at school until after 11 on Thursday because all Student Council members were needed to help with the dance.
Also, I had to work Friday evening and today at noon. The rest of my time has been taken up by homework from school.
Therefore, I didn't get as much work done on my 20time project as I would have liked. I also have to work next Tuesday, so
this weekend I will try to get all of my homework completed and if I have time left over, I will work on my 20time project.
I haven't figured out how to use the lav mic with my MacBook yet, so I haven't been making videos. But I am rereading *Escape
from Camp 14* and taking research notes. I might ask Mr. O on Tuesday to help me with the microphone. I also need to decide
what I'm going to say in my first video, so I might start putting together a speech and keeping it in the same repo on Github
as my log. So my goals for this coming week will be to fix the problem with the mic and also write the speech. I also decided
on Supreme Leader Albert as my YouTuber name. It's pretty catchy, it's related to the topic I will be making videos on, and it
isn't difficult to remember.


### Sunday, October 15, 2017: Day 16

This has been sort of a disappointing week. I have a bit of catching up to do on my work. It occurs to me that I still haven't put the 4 completed HTML projects onto a GitHub repo for ICS4U. I will do that immediately after I have finished wriing this log. I also haven't been able to get my external microphone to work with my MacBook. Mr. O has advised me to just make use of the built-in microphone for now in my videos. He's probably right: it's a better idea to go with what already works than to spend money buying a new adapter that may or may not work. So I've decided that this week, I will go ahead with making videos. First, I have to decide what content to include in my videos. I'll probably put that in this repo on GitHub as well. I also have to make some artwork and look for background music and sound effects that I can use in my video. I will also have to keep the videos short (not more than 3 minutes). In spite of this week's setbacks, I believe that the project's results in the end will be all worth it, so I will continue to work hard and get the YouTube channel up and running.
