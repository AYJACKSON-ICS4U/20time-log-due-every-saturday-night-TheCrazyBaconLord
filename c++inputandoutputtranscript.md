### C++ Input and Output Transcript

Greetings, my fellow human beings! My name is SupremeLeaderAlbert, and welcome back to another C++ tutorial video! In the last video, I showed you the different variable types in C++, and how to declare and call variables in your program. In this video, we'll be learning how to output a message to the screen. I'm sure you've seen me do this a couple of times in the last two videos, so you may already have an idea of how it is done. We'll also be learning about how to get the user to input a value that we then store in a variable. But first things first: #include<iostream>. I promised I would explain what this is. When you type #include, you are bringing in a subprogram. This particular one, <iostream>, is the code for input and output. If you don't bring it into the program with a #include command, the computer would not recognize your commands for outputting text to the screen or asking the user for input, and will spit out an error message. So, #include<iostream> brings in the code for input and output. If we want to use strings, which are an array of characters, we will need to type #include<string>. This brings in the code for strings. Underneath all of your #include commands, you want to type "using namespace std;". What you want to do now is type "int main", and open and close a set of round brackets. Don't put anything in the brackets. Then, we'll open a curly bracket, and you can see the program automatically completed a closing curly bracket for me. All
