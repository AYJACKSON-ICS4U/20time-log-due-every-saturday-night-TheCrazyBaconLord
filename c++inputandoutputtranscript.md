### C++ Input and Output Transcript

Greetings, my fellow human beings, and welcome back to another C++ tutorial video! In the last video, I showed you the different variable types in C++, and how to declare and call variables in your program. This is going to be a pretty brief video, because all we'll be doing today is learning how to print messages to the screen, and ask the user for input. I'm sure you've seen me do this a couple of times in the last two videos, so you may already have an idea of how it is done. It's really very simple. The two commands for output and input are cout<< and cin>>, respectively. There, we're done. End of video, please like and subscribe. 

Haha, no, I'm just kidding. We're not done yet. First things first: #include<iostream>. I promised I would explain what this is. When you type #include, you are bringing in a subprogram. This particular one, <iostream>, is the code for input and output. If you don't bring it into the program with a #include command, the computer would not recognize cout<< and cin>>, and will spit out an error message. This is necessary, and you should be putting it at the start of all your programs. If we want to use strings, we will need to type #include<string>. This brings in the subprogram that will allow for strings. Underneath all of your #include commands, you want to type "using namespace std;". This is also required. What you want to do now is type "main", and open and close a set of round brackets. Don't put anything in these brackets. Then, we'll open a curly bracket, and you can see the program automatically completed a closing curly bracket for me. Everything in these curly brackets are in the main program. For now, we will only write code inside main(). Now, let's say we want a program that will take in the user's name and output a message that greets them. Well, we'll have to store their name in a variable. So first of all, I'm going to declare a string variable and call it yourName. Now, we want to output a message that asks the user for their name. We'll use cout<<. You want to put your message in double quotations, if it is a string. So, I'm going to type cout<<"Enter your name. -> ";. Let's run this and see what happens. All right, so it asks the user for their name. Neat. But how can the user input their name? Well, we can use the cin>> command for that. Since we want to store the user's name in the yourName variable, we'll type cin>>yourName;. This means ask the user for input, and store that input in the following variable. Now, let's run the code again. You can see now, that it prompts the user for their name. I can type anything I want here, but for now, I'll write...um...Bob. And I'll press Enter. And that's the end of this program, because we haven't done anything else with it just yet. So let's close this, and go back to our code. Now, what if we want our program to take in the user's name as an input, and then say hi to them? Underneath the cin>>yourName, we'll write cout<<"Greetings and salutations, "<<yourName<<"!. Welcome to this program."; Here, we are calling the yourName variable in our cout<< command. So whatever string is stored in the yourName variable will be outputted. Let's run again, and see what happens. Now, we can see that if we enter a name, it stores that in a variable and outputs it with a greeting. All, right, now THAT is the end of this video. Goodbye.
